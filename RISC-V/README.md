RISC-V Simulator: Execution of binary files by loading into simulator memory and then decoding each 32-bit instruction one at a time starting from address 0 and continuing until instructed to stop.

Project is a simulation of a RISC-V disassembler and simulates execution of binary files.
- Purpose: creating a computing machine capable of executing real programs compiled with gcc.

Makefile is included
-> type in make / make clean to create and remove an executable named rv32i

Usages of the program are explained with simple rv32i execution command
